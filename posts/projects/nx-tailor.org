nx-tailor is a theme manager for the [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer][Nyxt]] browser. It leverages the built-in =nyxt/theme= library to allow defining multiple themes to switch between at browser runtime.

I developed this extension because to this day there's no easy way to preview Nyxt themes without restarting the browser and I wanted to bring the same REPL-based interactivity to theme development.

Since then, the feature set has grown and it now also supports user-specified criteria for theme selection at launch and a timer functionality to automatically switch it based on the time of the day.
