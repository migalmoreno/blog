#+SYNOPSIS: An Emacs interface to the F-Droid package repository

#+TITLE: fdroid.el
fdroid.el is a completion-based interface to work with F-Droid packages from Emacs.

Having to deal with Android emulators quite often and needing to install packages on initial setup, I developed this library to be able to quickly manage F-Droid packages without having to resort to the F-Droid website or having to download APKs manually.
