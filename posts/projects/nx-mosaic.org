nx-mosaic is a highly customizable new-buffer page (startpage) for the [[https://nyxt.atlas.engineer][Nyxt]] browser. It's inspired by the [[https://tabliss.io][Tabliss]] web extension and aims to create a Nyxt-native startpage that you can control to your heart's content through a wide array of widgets.
