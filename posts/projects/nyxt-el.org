nyxt.el is a minimal API to interact with Nyxt from Emacs. I developed this
library to make it easy for others to build their own Nyxt<->Emacs functionality.

For this, it contains a useful helper =nyxt-run= which launches or connects to an existing Nyxt process with a specified Nyxt command.

If you're only interested in getting data from Nyxt without sending any commands
through, you can use the =nyxt--sly-eval= internal function.
